**WORD COMPOSITION PROBLEM**
This Java program, LongestCompoundWord, is designed to find the longest and second-longest compound words within a given text file. Compound words are formed by concatenating other words from the input file. The program utilizes a TreeMap and a HashMap to efficiently store and process the words. Here, we provide a brief overview of the program and instructions for usage.
**FEATURES**
Reads a list of words from a text file.
Finds the longest compound word and the second-longest compound word.
Efficiently utilizes data structures like TreeMap and HashMap.
Provides the execution time in milliseconds.
**EXECUTION STEPS**
To run the program, proceed as follows:

1.Confirm that Java is installed on your computer.

2.Compile the program by executing the command:
javac Main.java
3.Launch the program by entering:
java Main
When prompted, input the filename of the target input file.

The program will then show the longest compounded word, the second longest compounded word, and the time it took to process the input file.
